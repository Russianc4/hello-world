Hello all and welcome!

I'm Joshua, I would like to be a programmer invloving A.I. or computing.
I wouldn't mind looking into making games too.
My hobbies are using my computer and phone to mainly surf the web looking a entertaining content.
I also play some video games, but I am trying to be "more productive" (work in progress :S)
I'm constantly in a fight with I would like to say a "lazy version of myself!".
